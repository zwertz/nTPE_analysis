//Companion implementation. A class to hold important quanties related to cut stability and systematic studies. utvar should only handle functions/processes on a case-by-case basis for data, mc p, mc n, and not all at once. A companion class to this is stability_analysis.h and stability_analysis.C. Will be modified as stability and systematic studies progress.

#include "../include/cutvar.h"

//public constructor implementation. Constructor, will initialize a cutvar object. Which will be centrally used to handle a lot of the necessary info for the stability study. All private variables will be based on the cutvar input through conditionals.
